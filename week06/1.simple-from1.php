    <!-- 
    To recap/review to what we have covered in HTML and CSS module:       
    HTML <form> element:
    Every form should have the following two main types of attributes:
           - action
           - method

            method attribute values:
            - GET => the default one to be used 
            - POST

            Method attribute:
            two main (common) types of methods that are used by PHP Developers when we submit the form:
            - GET: (the default if you don't specify)
            * method="get" or method="GET" (The Default)
            * is less secured (the info will be attached to the URL)
            * can handle few data (simple forms)
            * doesn't support file upload feature
            * is usually used for the "Search Form" only

            - POST:
            * method="post" or method="POST"
            * is more secured (the info will be imbedded with the page) 
            * can handle large amount of data (simple to more complex forms)
            * supports file upload feature
            * is used for contact us form, registration form, login from etc. (except search form)

            https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/php-tutorial/php-get-and-post.php

            Action attribute: 
            This attribute tells the browser where to send the data
            which could be the address of the file on the server that contains the script/code 
            for handling the data either by sending it using email or save it to the database for example

            if using Apache with XAMPP => so the server will be the same "localhost"

            The file that contains the code for handling the form, it is written in a programming language like:
            - PHP (the most popular web programming language - our current module)
            - C#
            - JAVA
            - Python
            - Ruby
            - etcâ€¦ 
    
            action = "filename.extension"

            Examples of action values:
            - action="process.php" => a file named process.php will handle the form
            process.php is just an external file (if it's exist) to handle the form 

            File examples: process.php or register.php are just example names!

        Remember:
        - $_GET => a super global associative array is used with form if the method="GET" 
        - $_POST => a super global associative array is used with form if the method="POST"

        let's use method="get" in this example (we shouldn't use get Only with search form)

        form-process.php is the file to write our code for handling this form

        URL: http://localhost/comp1006/201/week06/form-process.php

        Question: What could happen if we don't give any value to action attribute: action=""
        Answer: The from will be submitted to the same current page
    -->
    <form action="form-process.php" method="GET" id="my-from" class="main-form">
<!--
            Each form field that will be used/need to be used in our PHP code
            has to have a "name" attribute with a unique value

            The "name" attribute of each form input/field 
            will be used by PHP code as the key for the PHP global associative array
            wether we use $_GET[] or $_POST[]


            With forms, PHP provides for us 2 Global Associative Arrays to handle the form elements:
            -> $_POST[] => we have to use/access/call the associative array $_POST[]
            if the form method="POST"
            -> $_GET[]  => we have to use/access/call the associative array $_GET[]
            if the form method="GET"

            Our current form field(s):	5 input fields and 1 textarea field.
            The 4 input fields (elements):
            - type="text"
            - type="email"
            - type="tel"
            - type="submit"
            - type="rest"

            block-level elements => <div>, p, li, ul, ol, heading,
            inline elements => <span>
        -->
        <div>
            <label for="name">Full Name:</label>
            <input type="text" name="name" id="name">

            <!-- 
                In order to submit this form which means to be sent to the server side,
                we have to use the type of "submit"
             -->
            <input type="submit" name="send" id="send" value="Send Comments">
                <!-- 
                    we don't need to add: name="reset" for the reset button! 
                    even if we add it, it will be ignored by PHP
                -->
